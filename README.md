**Formula 1 Racing 2023**

**Summary**
This project creates a dashboard to summarize the current standings of the Formula 1 2023 results. On the page is displayed an interactive line chart. The user may select two drivers from two separate dropdown menus to compare their finishing place in each race. At the time of writing this, the 2023 season is not complete, but this graph will update with each new race. There is also a pie chart to show the number of victories per driver for those with at least one victory. A world map is displayed to show all of the locations the Formula 1 races have been hosted between the years 1950-2023. There is also a table which displays statistics on the drivers in the 2023 line-up for the purpose of comparison. A second table displays the scheduled locations for the 2023 line-up. This information is for educational use only and should not be used for decision making.
